## directory for DAVID output files. 

### [`single-crab-genes`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-tanner-crab/tree/master/analyses/DAVID-outputs/single-crab-genes):       
`DAVID` output files from the single crab genes over time heatmap clusters (**Fig. 3**)     
6 clusters, one file per clusters. Clusters 5 and 6 are very small compared to the other 4, and as such are not discussed in the paper. 

### [`temp-contrast-DEGs`](https://github.com/RobertsLab/paper-tanner-crab/tree/master/analyses/DAVID-outputs/temp-contrast-DEGs):
`DAVID` output files from (**Fig. 2**) for the first three clusters. The fourth cluster didn't have any `DAVID` results.
